        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 first:mt-0">What is Ohm's Law?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electronics and electrical engineering that asserts the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit. It is expressed by the formula V = IR, where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          Understanding Ohm's Law is crucial for analyzing electrical circuits and is widely applied in various situations, from designing circuits to troubleshooting electrical problems. Different branches of engineering and science utilize this foundational concept to build reliable systems.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          In practical applications, Ohm's Law allows engineers and technicians to ensure that electrical devices operate under safe and efficient conditions. For instance, determining the correct resistor value when designing a circuit or ensuring that components can handle the voltage and current levels present.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">How to Use the Ohm's Law Calculator</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          To use the Ohm's Law calculator, you can input any two of the three variables: voltage (V), current (A), and resistance (Ω). The calculator will automatically compute the missing value based on the inputs provided. This feature simplifies complex calculations, making it easy to experiment and learn.
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-4 rounded-r">
          <code className="text-base font-mono text-gray-900">
            V = I × R
          </code>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          For example, if you know the current flowing through a circuit and the resistance, you can calculate the voltage using the formula above. 
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          Additionally, you can easily reverse the computation. For instance, if you have the voltage and current, simply rearranging the formula allows you to find resistance:
        </p>
        <div className="bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-4 rounded-r">
          <code className="text-base font-mono text-gray-900">
            R = V / I
          </code>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          This flexibility makes the Ohm's Law calculator a powerful tool for both students and professionals in the field of electronics.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Common Use Cases</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          Ohm's Law is integral in many fields, including electrical engineering, circuit design, and even physics education. It helps professionals and students alike perform calculations involving power consumption, select appropriate power supplies, and ensure safety standards in electrical setups.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          For example, in circuit design, engineers must ensure that components can tolerate and dissipate the heat generated by current flow. By applying Ohm's Law, they can calculate the necessary resistance to avoid overheating or failure of critical components.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-7">
          Additionally, this law aids in understanding the behaviors of circuits in series and parallel arrangements, essential for any aspiring electrician or engineer.
